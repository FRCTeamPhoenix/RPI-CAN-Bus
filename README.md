# RPI-CAN-Bus
Code for testing encoders and such on a Rasberri Pi

# Helping Out
The python code for modifying encoders may only be written on the rasberry pi.
If you want to design gui for the application, download and install glade3 on your computer. 
Make sure the toolkit is GTK 3.0 if prompted.
You can write ui code by installing gtk+ 3.0 for python.
Non-ui or can encoder code may be written anywhere.
